Things that need to be done:
===========================
2.7.8
* Add a realpath variant accessor that resolves whole path in auparse
* ausearch text format, add 'to xxx' for file perm/owner, & uid/gid changes
* Optionally don't verify email address domain
* Add autrace EPERM/EACCES mode

2.8
* Look into TLS support
* non-equality comparisons for values other than \timestamp, \timestamp_ex and \record_type in ausearch-expression (#1399314)
* Add rule verify to detect mismatch between in-kernel and on-disk rules
* Add sockaddr accessor functions in auparse
* Support multiple time streams when searching
* In audispd, look into non-blocking handling of write to plugins
* Re-write auvirt
* Fix auvirt to report AVC's and --proof for --all-events

2.9
* Look at pulling audispd into auditd
* auditd.conf space_left sizes can be %
* Add ability to filter events in auditd
* Fix audit.pc.in to use Requires.private
* If auparse input is a pipe timeout events by wall clock
* If relative file, use cwd to build (realpath). watch out for (null) and socket
* Change ausearch to output name="" unless its a real null. (mount) ausearch-report.c, 523. FIXME

3.0
* Basic HIDS
* Support ipv6 remote logging
* Consolidate linked lists and other functions
* Consolidate parsing code between libaudit and auditd-conf.c
* Performance improvements for auparse (Memory management)

3.0.1
* Fix SIGHUP for auditd network settings
* Add gzip format for logs
* Add keywords for time: month-ago

3.0.2
* Look at adding the direction read/write to file report (threat modelling)
* Changes in uid/gid, failed changes in credentials in aureport

3.1
* Allow -F path!=/var/my/app
* Look at openat and why passed dir is not given
* Add SYSLOG data source for auparse. This allows leading text before audit       messages, missing type, any line with no = gets thrown away. iow, must have     time and 1 field to be valid.
* Fix aureport accounting for avc in permissive mode

3.1.1
* Fix aureport-scan to properly decide if CONFIG_CHANGE is add or del, need to optionally look for op and use remove/add to decide
